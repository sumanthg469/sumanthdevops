A Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a
 partition. ... It stores 
the data on hard disks (HDD) or some equivalent storage type.
 There may be below reasons for maintaining the file system:
 Primarily the computer saves data to the RAM storage; 
it may lose the data if it gets turned off.

==========================================
hera disk is a one file in linux but that disk we need to tell which type of file to linux 
so we using mkfs -type ext4 disk path. ---linux understand this is disk 
then we want to mount that disk to dir of os files.

1) create a volume and attached to i1
2) that volume called editonla volume 
3) that editonal volume is attached to os file dir
we need 1) we have to tell that editonal volume to linux using cmd
                 mkfs -t ext4 diskpath
        2) we want to check that file systemappliying or not that disk using
          blkid /dev/xvdf
         3) mount /dev/xvdt /home/ubuntu/d1
when we modify volume that file system not expand in in server  ---so we check df -h total gb created file system or not 
then not showing we can resize that disk using cmd     resize 2fs /dev/xvdf 
 
 now we store in d1 dir files stored in editonal volme
 4) now we want to see how much storage is used that disk's how much avalible
using with   df -h
lsblk lists information about all available or the specified block devices

5) df -h(disk free human redable folemat)---- it will give information about disk usages how much used how much fess all those things

6) Command	Option
du -a	List all files and directories size
du -h	Display in human readable format
du -c	Display grand total in the output
du -s	Display only total
Command du stands for Disk Usage. It is used to 
check the information of curent dir  usage of files and directories on a system.
To verify the file system for each volume, use the df -hT command.

The ext4 journaling file system or fourth extended filesystem is a journaling file system for Linux, 
developed as the successor to ext3.
Supported operating systems

mkfs means make a file system: means drive you can make a file system
file system stores multiple files 
that file system we can attached to os dir
so waht ever files we can store in that dir that files stored in thak diskor that file system.
=========================================================
we taken root volume os created that volume to file system 
that file system attached to the / dir.
resize2fs /dev/xvdf



=======================================================================
root volume attached (/) -this tasj done by os only
editonal volume we can manually attached to that os dir.
root-volume means ---os files are stored in that volume
root volume stating from /
===========================================================================
we take editonal volume to connect to instancse
but server dont know that harddisk for storing for files
system only understand filesystem
we want to convert to disk to file sytem
1)to using ------mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
server now understand that disk we can store files
2) so we that filesytem attached to os dir
using
mount /dev/xvdf /home/ubuntu/d1
when we store in d1 files that files stores in the editional volume
3) lsblk ---it shows how many dires are there and what mount point it will show
4) df -h---it will show disk usage human redable format 
6) du --it will show in curent dir files how much ocupy storege info
7) blkid ----it will show file system created or not on disk volume
8) df -th--it will show disk usage and file system type
9) when ever unmout that disk to os dir umount /dev/xvdf
10) when ever we modify volume server does not know anout aditonal storage becase we can apply filesystem on aditonla volume
so we want to resize the file sytem on that disk volume using
resize2fs /dev/xvdf
11) when ever we stop and start the instance that disk is identified by default but mount point doesnot identified
so when we start that disk is free not attached any dir
12) server start then it will understand of mountpoint we mention on /etc/fstab then it will understand that disk mounted to the 
dir

uuid=""  /dir     default   0,1

1)lsblk
2)mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
3)blkid /dev/xvdf
4)mount /dev/xvdf /home/ubuntu/d1
5)df -h

what is diff between ami/snapshot
snapshot is the backup of server we not posible to attach the machine using snapshot
ami is it containes os files it posible to luanch ec2-instance
============================
ec2---it is spcific to region
1) ami
2) storage
3) system type
4)instance purchase type
on demend
spot
reserv
5) ebs volume
6)ami
7)snapshot
8)sg
9) keypair
10)userdata----boot strapting
11) instance have ip adress: 
  private ip
  public ip is chargable teher are 2 types
     a) tempory public ip
      b) static ip adress

12) instante state
=================================
instance allways have hard disk
1)volums
    a) root volume - in which device containes os files
with out root volume we can not luanch server    
b) ram/memory/harddisk-----ram is temp memory and memory ram both are same
hd --persistantant storage
================================
ami
instance type
volume
===========================
sg --who wants to give acess to your machine
sg act as a fire wall to your instance
in sg we can mention   port   sourch
ib
ob
===============================================
what mean by network interface.
multiple ip assign to server
because ip assign to nic card
we can put 2 or 3 cpu to server.
============================================
network interface card 

==========================================

tasks:
1) create your own ssh keys
2) upload the key
3) create sg,allow below rules
ib  22 --froyour machine
    80---from all ips
ob 
   80,443 to all ips
4) luanch ubuntu ec2-instance attach step3 sg & step 1 keypair
5) login into that instance
6) install apache2
7) create a user sheshi
8) reset userpasswd and note down
9)create custom ami
10) luanch ec2 new instance from step 9 ami
custom ami means we can luanch server using 
our ami(os)+root volume we can luanch server
that root volume attached to the / one
11) login into step 10 instance and check apache2 is installed or not
12) give permision on step 10 ami to 950829519464 aws account
=================================================
13) luanch ec2 ubuntu useing userdata install linux
14) check nginx is acessable from browser or not

#!/bin/bash
apt-get update 
apt-get install nginx -y

all userdata excuted by root user

userdata---means bootstaping
bootstaping--when ever server is luanching that user data is 
excuting.
