types of elb:
1) clasic loadbalancing
2) application load balancer
3) network load balancer
4) gateway loadbalancer

here all load balancer functonality is same distubuted load b/w multiple servers
what ever req taking the it forwarded to the instance that instance called target 
===============================================
i have application airtel.in
in that 2 servicess are there 
1) prepaid application
2) postpaid application
here lot of customers for prepaid application ------4 servers for prepaid
here less number of for postpaid app---------2 servers for postapaid
==================================================================
4+2=6 servers this 6 servers are attached to the elb 


here 600 req come from 400 for prepaid req anf 400 for postpaid req

400-----prepaid
200---postpaid req

that 400 req land on prepaid servers
200 req land on postpaid req server's
====================
1) we dont have a write option for condition in clasic load balancers
=============================
2) in application level possible to write condition on application load balancer

condition 1: in path containng prepaid keyword send that req to prepaidtargetgroup
condition 2: in path containng postpaid keyword send that req to postpaidtargetgroup

that facility is there in application load balancer

here prepaid servers connect with prepaidtarget-group{i1 i2 i3 i4}
here postpaid servers connect with postpaidtarget-group{i5  i6}

application load balancer i want to attached to the targetgroups---------------instancess
clasic lb attached to directly ---instancess

alb we can connecting to multiple group our resposiblity to tell to alb which req forwarded to which group.
default---that path's not satisfying that req land on default thing

in-realtime 10 to 15 groups are there.



condition we can write in elb level

========================================================================
alb-------90---------grp1----80->i1 i2 i3 i4
                     grp2----8080----i5 i6



=============================================================
grp------targetgroup
