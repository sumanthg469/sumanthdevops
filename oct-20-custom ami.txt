region: every regions containes multiple avavalabilty zones
>=2
avalabilityzone:
avalability zone is called datacenter where your infrsture is avalabile
infrsture menas 
1) server
2) hard-disk
3) network related things
======================================================
ec2- is a region specfic not a global
ec2-means server managemnt: 
creating instance
luanch instance
login instance
attach storage to instance
tack a back of instance
upgrade and down grade instances
changing conf files
installing and updating instancess
delete instace 
all are called the server management
==================================================
aws:
     ec2:   
          a) instance/vm/server
           b) instance type: which con macine you want
            c) instance purchase option
                ---------> on demand
               ------------> spot
                ---> reserv
            d) ebs volume
                 e) bares metal: without os is called plane machine


e) we want to installon bare metal we can use the ami
this ami also specfic to region only 
this ami are not allowd in another region code is diff image having unique id
f) snapshotbacjup of storage

what is diff b/w ami and snapshot:
using of ami we can istall os in bare metal and we can luanch insrance
using of snapshot not possible to luanch ec2.
g) sg
h) keypairs

public key in aws private key we are having
g) userdata:
what is booting: loding os(installing the os) 
we can write any script that script excute  after installing the os 
that is called userdata
we can give in userdata option.
that script excute when ec2-iuanch
h) ip's
private ip
public ip: temporary ip
eip: static ip
i) instante state
=====================================
your script write userdata field  that script excuting when ec2-instance luanch
===============================================
volumes
a) root volume : means where your os is avavlible
when we stop the instance and start how system knows which disk i want to luanch os 
xvda
all are editional volme
ram/memory/hd
ram: means temp memory
hd: perment memory
========================================
our keypair give to instance 
using of impoty key
============================
internally ip afress is attached to nic
technically speke we can attache multiple ips to machine
machine having 2 slotes ram we can create 2 ip's to that machine
----------------------
in nic card we can called network interface
=============================
tag: we can give multiple name 
this server is having which app
this server belongs to
=========================================================

tasks:
1) create your own ssh keys
2) create a sg, allow below rules
   IB: 22 ----> FROM YOUR MACHIONE
   IB : 80     FROM ALL IPS
   OB :  80,443  TO ALL IPS
3) LUANCH UBUNTU EC2-INSTANCE ATTACH STEP3 SG AND STEP1 KEY PAIR
4) LOGIN INTO THAT INSTANCE
5) INSTALL APACHE2
6) CREATE USER "SHESHI"
7) RESERT PASSWD AND NOTE DOWN
8) CREATE CUSTOM AMI
9) LUANCH EC2-INSTANCE FROM AMI
10) LOGIN INTO STEP10 INSTANCE AND CHECK APACHE2 IS INSTALLED OR NOT
12) GIVR PERMISIONS ON STEP10 AMI TO "45555"
13) LOGIN INTO STEP4 MACHINE SHESHI USER FROM STEP10 INSTANCE UBUNTU USER

==================================
LUANCH EC2-INSTANCE UBUNTU INSTANCE, USING USSERDATA INSTALL NGINX
CHECK NGINX INSTALL OR NOT
