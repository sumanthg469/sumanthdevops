AMI-------AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE

IT CONTAINS OS FILES.
THAT OS FILES STORED AWS IN S3 BUCKET
WHEN EVER WE LUANCH EC2 -INSTANCE OS IS MANDOTORY
THAT AMI CONTAINES LINUX OS THEN THAT OS FILES STORED IN OUR
EC2 IN VOLUME WHEN EC2 INSTANCE LANCH THA OS IS RUNS CPU AND MEMORY FROM VOLUME
EC2 - INSTANCE IS RUNNING .
THAT OS FILES AND CONFIG FILES PLACED IN /ETC DIR
VOLUME MEANS STORAGE VOLUME CONTAINES ALL OS FILES AND SOFTWARE FILES SERVICE FILES 
WITH OUT AMI,CPU,MEMORY,VOLUME,SG,KEYPAIR, WE ARE NOT ALLOWDED TO LAUNCH INSTANCE
=============================================
WE CREATE CUSTOM AMI MEANS THAT CUSTOM AMI ATTACHED TO THAT ROOT VOLUME OF EC2-INSTANCE
WHEN WE LUANCH CUSTOMAMI FROM EC2. THAT AMI LUANCH WITH ATTACHED VOLUME 
SO CUSTOM AMI FILES LUNACH IN VOLUME OF ROOT OF PRVIOUS EC2.SO
PERIVOUS EC2. CUSTOM AMI EC2 ARE TWINS.
WHAT EVER PRIVIOUS EC2 HAVING ALL OS,SOFTWARES,SERVICESS,USERDATA,USERS GETTING CUSTOM AMI MACHINE ALSO
===========================================
WHEN WE CREATED CUSTOM AMI . 
1) CREATED CUSTOM AMI
2) CREATED THAT EC2-INSTANCE VOLUME SNAPSHOT
3) WE LUANCH EC2 FROM CUSTOM AMI . VOLUME TAKEN FROM THAT SNAPSHOT ONLY.
THAT CUSTOM OS PLACED IN VOLUME AND WHEN LUANCH EC2 THAT OS FILES EXCUTING.
THAT VOLUME HAVING SAME EXACT DATA OF THAT VOLUME BECAUSE WE TAKEN VOLUME FROM THAT VOLUME SNAPSHOT
ONLY
=========================================================================
we taken from instance to custom ami - both are twins
====================================================
private-key having permisions 400.
ssh -command means send that req to ssh serverice on particular port
by default port 22

when ever we login into machine we want 
1)username
2)ipadress
3) passwd or private key(private key we tell to ssh -i this file you taken)
4) send req for that server ssh service we want command ssh.
============================================================================
when ever we luanch a machine we need
1) ami
2)instance type
3) volume--volume taken from one snpshot only
4) security group
5) keypairs
=====================================================
ec2-instance states---start,stop,terminate,reboot.
==================================================
when we luanch ec2 we take storage in that storage we can attach root device
then again we attach aditional device to /dev/sfd
