============================alb(based on condition which req send to which group path doesnot containg anything 
it will send to default group))
elb---are 2 types
1) internet facing 
2) internal facing
=========================
elb 's are 4 types
1) clasic elb
2) application elb
3) network elb
4) gateway elb

all elb's are fucnalitys are same req's are taking and distubuted to the 
multuple servers(targets)

clasic load balancer send req all servers we are not posible to configure condition in classic
aws recomnded to the not use clasic elb
90 to 95% used in real-time---------aelb

based on application
based on your condition we can crete target group's and the tg attached alb

===================================
we maintaine application in that 2 servicess are there
1) prepaid
2) postpaid

so for prepaid we maintaine 4 server's
so for postpaid we maintaine 2 server's


1)we want to distubuted req to servers
2) distubuted req to servers when it is prepaid req so want to send req to prepaid 4 servers
3) distubuted req to servers when it is postpaid req so want to send req to postpaid 4 servers

but we are using clasic elb every req forwarded every machine 
i want to req send particular postpaid prepaid servers differnt

this solution is application elb

when ever we maintaine 2 servicess for 6 server's like above
1) we create target groups for prepaid sevice servers and postpaid service servers
2) we want to creTE ALB AND ATTACHED TO TARGET GROUP'S BECAUSE OF CONDITON 
3) LUANCH SERVERS FOR PREPAID AND POSTPAID 
4) PREPAID SERVERS TO CONNECT PREPAID TARGET GROUP AND POSTPAID SERVERS CONNECT TO POSTPAID TARGET GROUP
5) EVERY TARGET GROUP WE CAN ATTACHE MULTIPLE SERVER'S BUT TARGET GROUP WE CAN ATTACHED INSTANCE PORT ONLY ONE
=============================================================================================
NOTE: 
1) ALB WE CAN LISTING PORTS WE CAN CONFIGURE MULTIPLE
2) ALB WE CAN ATTACH TO MULTIPLE TARGET GROUP'S
3) ALB LEVEL WE CAN CONFIGURE CONDITION'S
4) IN TAGET GROUP WE CAN CONFIGURE ONLY ONE INSTANCE PORT
5) TARGET GROUP WE CAN ATTACHED TO ULTIPLE INSTANCESS
6) BASED ON CONDITION ALB SEND REQ TO TARGET GROUP'S 
7) TARGET GROUP'S TAKE REQ AND SEND TO THE ATTACHED SERVER'S
=====================================================
IN REAL-TIME WE CONFIGURE 

ALB LISTING PORT ONLY ONE 

-------80--------ALB---based on condition it req send to -----TG1---(i1,i2,i3,i4)
                                                              Tg2----(i5,i6)
                                                               tg3--(default)---i5,i6


=============================================================
default group: it mandotary in alb 
default target group means in path not satsifying condition then the req go to default thing
=============================

targetgrouplevel:=================1) application port
                                  2) health info

alb========================1) lb port
                           2) default group
                            3) condition





====================================================
tasks:
1) luanch ubuntu server's for prepaid application(service)

#!bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2 -y
cd /var/www/html
mkdir prepaid && cd prepaid
echo this is prepaid server $(hostname) > test.html

2) luanch 2 ubuntu for postpaid 


#!bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2 -y
cd /var/www/html
mkdir prepaid && cd prepaid
echo this is prepaid server $(hostname) > test.html

3) create two tg's for
1) prepaid application (80) runs on 80 port on 3 ubuntu instancess
2) postpaid application(80)---runs on 80 on 2 ubuntu instancess

4) create application lb attache to 2 target groups to alb
5) try to acess "test.html" page from aelb dnx name
=========================================================
tasks: 
sing
1)create vpc1 ------10.0.0.0/16
2) create 3 public subnets
sn1----10.0.0.0/24
sn2----10.0.1.0/24
sn3----10.0.2.0/24

3) crete 3 private subnets attach nat gatway 
sn1----10.0.3.0/24
sn2----10.0.4.0/24
sn3----10.0.5.0/24

4) create sg for elb allow below rules
ib--------90
ob--all trafic
5) create sg for prepaiod app , allow below rules
ib---80'
ob----all
6) create sg for postpaid app , allow below rules
ib---8080
ob----all

6) create prepaID TG(APPLICATION RUNNING ON 80)
7) create pOSTPAID TG(APPLICATION RUNNING ON 8080)
8) CREATE APPLICATION ELB (IN PUBLIC SUBNETS), ATTACH PREPAIDTG AS DEFAULT
9) CREATE RULES, TO FORWARD REQ POSTPAIDTG
  IF PATH CONTAINNG "POSTPAID"

10) CREATE RULES, TO FORWARD REQ PREPAIDTG
  IF PATH CONTAINNG "PREPAID"

11) CREATE UBUNTU EC2-MACHINE IN SN1
12) INSTALL NFS SERVER SOFTWARE
13) CREATE TWO DIR
   /home/ubuntu/prepaid
   /home/ubuntu/prepaid
14) luanch two instancess for prepaid application & install apache2
15) mount step11 instance dir /var/www/html/prepaid to step 14 instance /home/ubuntu/prepaid
16) luanch one instancess for postpaid application & install tomcat
17)  mount step11 instance dir /var/www/html/prepaid to step 16 instance /home/ubuntu/prepaid
